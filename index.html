                <p>You're 10 years old. You have made the mature choice to leave home forever to wander the world to tame animals and make them fight for sport. Thankfully, you are family friends with an unscrupulous geneticist who happens to have three endangered animals under his care. He allows you to choose one to begin your bloody conquest, while provoking his grandson, your childhood friend, into a bitter rivalry with you. The choice can be daunting at first, so here's a handy reference if you're not sure which one to pick.</p>

                    <p><span>Bulbasaur</span> grows the fastest and is the most effective against the two starting gyms, yet tends not to be as strong later on in the game, even after evolving into the Solar-Beam-capable <span>Venusaur</span>.</p>

                    <p><span>Charmander</span> faces a stiff uphill battle at first, particularly ineffective against the first few gyms, and has the steepest growth curve; however, it evolves into the phenomenally powerful <span>Charizard</span> at later levels.</p>
